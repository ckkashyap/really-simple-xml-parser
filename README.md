really-simple-xml-parser
========================

A really simple xml parser in Haskell using Parsec.
I wrote this primarily to learn Parsec and I intend to use it in my automations where I need to parse XML's returned from bug tracking systems and other systems.

I am not an XML fan - in fact, I hate it.

I'd like to acknowledge the help I got from the wonderful Haskell community for this. I'd particularly like to call out the help provided by the following folks -

2. Aparajit
